/* BEFORE WRITING YOUR NEXT CODE VISUALIZE EVERYTHING IN YOUR MIND LIKE A STORY
Its ALL  CONNECTED MF
JUST THINK OF WHAT IT IS YOU WANT TO DO
EG
YOU WANT TO ADD A NEW LI TAG IN AN UNORDERED LIST 
SO YOU MUST GET A REFERENCE TO THAT UL

const ul = document.querySelector("ul");

YOU ALSO NEED A REFERENCE TO THE BUTTON CLICKED FOR ADDING A NEW LI TAG 


const button = document.querySelector("button");

button.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
e.target.classList.add("
}

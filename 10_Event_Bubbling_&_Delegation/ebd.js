/* BEFORE WRITING YOUR NEXT CODE VISUALIZE EVERYTHING IN YOUR MIND LIKE A STORY
Its ALL  CONNECTED MF
JUST THINK OF WHAT IT IS YOU WANT TO DO
EG
YOU WANT TO ADD A NEW LI TAG IN AN UNORDERED LIST 
SO YOU MUST GET A REFERENCE TO THAT UL

const ul = document.querySelector("ul");

YOU ALSO NEED A REFERENCE TO THE BUTTON CLICKED FOR ADDING A NEW LI TAG 


const button = document.querySelector("button");

button.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
e.target.classList.add("
}
what is a stack and a heap? whats the difference
global scope vs local scope

window object vs the local object

do you understand what we mean by normal fn cannot be defined in an object
but methods can be defined in an object
 do you understand an array of objects - basically this is what you will work with 90% 
 
Try and visualize even the basics like math function what it does, its use cases, forEACH method application, the this keyword etc
Programming is more of understanding what youre doing and less of coding
Make sure you do that tomorrow and also make it a habit

FEAR A MAN WHO HAS PRACTICED A SINGLE KICK A THOUSANDS TIMES
